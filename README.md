It's a "storeMANAGER"! I have created a website for managing a store for small retail shop owners.
live website: https://storemanager.netlify.app/

Features :
1. A system where they can easily add new products, update their details and remove outdated ones.
2. Track how many of each item they have in stock and notify when they need to restock.
3. Record each sale and have it automatically update inventory levels.
4. Generate reports showing what's selling well and what's low in stock.
